# Replicating Memcache Issue

1) Run `lando start` to build up the environment.
2) Visit `http://localhost:55028/index.php?set_values` to initiate setup (use your port #)
3) Run a few times `curl -s  http://localhost:55028/index.php`, or just visit the page in browser a bunch.
4) View the discrepancies ðŸ˜¬

After a while, can switch to using `http://localhost:55028/?no_oom` and load that a few times. Can see how it still has a backlog of errorsome returns, but will eventually start working correctly again and consistently.
